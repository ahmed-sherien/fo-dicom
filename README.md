# Fellow Oak DICOM for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 apps

Copyright (c) 2012-2013 Colby Dillion, adaptations to Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 (c) 2012-2015 Anders Gustafsson, Cureos AB

This is a fork of Colby Dillion's [fo-dicom](https://github.com/rcd/fo-dicom) toolkit, aimed at Windows 8.1 (for desktops and tablets) and Windows Phone 8.1 applications. This repository provides libraries with postfixes *Windows* and *Phone*, targetting Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1, respectively.

To sufficiently use the library in a Windows 8.1 application, consider enabling the following capabilities and declarations in the application manifest file:

* Documents Library capability
* Internet (Client & Server) capability
* Private Networks (Client & Server) capability
* Removable Storage capability
* File Type Associations declaration e.g. for files with extensions *.dcm* and *.dic*

At this stage, the *DICOM.Windows* and *DICOM.Phone* class libraries expose the same API as the regular .NET Framework *fo-dicom* class library. *DICOM.Windows* and *DICOM.Phone* currently do not publicly expose 
[Windows Runtime API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211377.aspx) asynchronous methods for file and network I/O etc. 

The libraries have dependencies to native (C/C++) codec classes and therefore have to be built separately for each platform. Supported platforms are *x86*, *x64* (only Windows Store) and *ARM*.

Compared to the regular *fo-dicom* class library, *DICOM.Windows* and *DICOM.Phone* exhibit the following known limitations:

* Only Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) client is supported, SSL server functionality is *not* enabled.
* Database query transforms are not supported, i.e. it is not possible to update a DICOM dataset based on a database query.

Issues directly related to using *fo-dicom* in Windows 8.1 or Windows Phone 8.1 applications can be reported [here](https://github.com/cureos/fo-dicom/issues).

# Fellow Oak DICOM for .NET

Please join the [Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/fo-dicom) for updates and support. Binaries are available from [GitHub](https://github.com/rcd/fo-dicom/releases) and [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/fo-dicom).

### Features
* High-performance, fully asynchronous, .NET 4.0 API
* JPEG (including lossless), JPEG-LS, JPEG2000, and RLE image compression
* Supports very large datasets with content loading on demand
* Image rendering

### Notes
* Support for compressed images requires the Visual Studio 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package to be installed. ([x86](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8328) or [x64](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632)) 

### Examples

#### File Operations
```csharp
var file = DicomFile.Open(@"test.dcm");

var patientid = file.Dataset.Get<string>(DicomTag.PatientID);

file.Dataset.Add(DicomTag.PatientsName, "DOE^JOHN");

// creates a new instance of DicomFile
file = file.ChangeTransferSyntax(DicomTransferSyntax.JPEGProcess14SV1);

file.Save(@"output.dcm");
```

#### Render Image to JPEG
```csharp
var image = new DicomImage(@"test.dcm");
image.RenderImage().Save(@"test.jpg");
```

#### C-Store SCU
```csharp
var client = new DicomClient();
client.AddRequest(new DicomCStoreRequest(@"test.dcm"));
client.Send("127.0.0.1", 12345, false, "SCU", "ANY-SCP");
```

#### C-Echo SCU/SCP
```csharp
var server = new DicomServer<DicomCEchoProvider>(12345);

var client = new DicomClient();
client.NegotiateAsyncOps();
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    client.AddRequest(new DicomCEchoRequest());
client.Send("127.0.0.1", 12345, false, "SCU", "ANY-SCP");
```

#### C-Find SCU
```csharp
var cfind = DicomCFindRequest.CreateStudyQuery(patientId: "12345");
cfind.OnResponseReceived = (DicomCFindRequest rq, DicomCFindResponse rp) => {
	Console.WriteLine("Study UID: {0}", rp.Dataset.Get<string>(DicomTag.StudyInstanceUID));
};

var client = new DicomClient();
client.AddRequest(cfind);
client.Send("127.0.0.1", 104, false, "SCU-AE", "SCP-AE");
```

#### C-Move SCU
```csharp
var cmove = new DicomCMoveRequest("DEST-AE", studyInstanceUid);

var client = new DicomClient();
client.AddRequest(cmove);
client.Send("127.0.0.1", 104, false, "SCU-AE", "SCP-AE");
```
